The information on this website was written with the help of Grammarly but modified and checked by its developer, Brandon (Myself).

Helped by fixing the structure and rewriting a sentence to come across as casual or simplistic to read. 


The code used in this is written by myself with help from dev forms, and I have supplied the link to the forums where I felt it was applicable Aka it was the fix I needed

in a case where I didn't feel it applied is where it was a hint but I still figured it out by myself or fixed it on my own.
