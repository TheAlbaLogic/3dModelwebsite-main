      <p class="bptext"> The T-34 chassis was a revolutionary design that combined mobility, protection, and ease of
        maintenance. Its sloped armour offered excellent protection with it making incoming anti-tank fire ricochet and its Christie suspension provided superior
        cross-country mobility. The tank's simple yet effective transmission and diesel engine allowed it to operate
        efficiently over long distances, and its modular design ensured that it could be quickly repaired in the field.
        All of these factors combined to make the T-34 one of the most effective and feared tanks of World War II,
        playing a pivotal role in the USSR's success on the Eastern Front.</p>

          <h3>Hull Construction</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Welded steel hull with sloped armour.

            Capability:

            The T-34's hull was made primarily of welded steel, offering a relatively simple and cost-effective method
            of construction compared to cast hulls.

            The hull was notably sloped at a 30-degree angle, which increased its effective thickness and provided
            significant improved protection against incoming fire by increasing the chance of deflecting enemy shells.

            The sloped design was revolutionary at the time, making the T-34 one of the most effective tanks in terms of
            armour protection early in WWII.

          </li>

          <h3>Armour Thickness</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Up to 45mm thick.

            Capability:

            The T-34's front hull armour was typically 45mm thick but due to its slope, it effectively provided the same
            protection as much thicker armour.

            The side armour was 40mm thick, while the rear armour was thinner, around 30mm.

            Despite being thinner than many contemporary German tanks, the sloping armour made the T-34 highly resistant
            to many types of shells at typical combat ranges during the early part of the war.

          </li>

          <h3> Turret Ring and Mount</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Rotating turret ring.

            Capability:

            The turret ring was a key feature of the T-34's chassis, allowing the fully rotating turret to engage
            targets in any direction.

            The T-34's turret ring was designed to allow a wide range of turret movement (360Â°), which enhanced the
            tank's versatility and capability in combat situations. This made the T-34 effective in both offensive and
            defensive actions, as it could quickly engage multiple targets in various directions without needing to
            reposition the entire vehicle.

          </li>

          <h3> Fuel Tanks and Engine Compartment</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Two fuel tanks located at the rear of the chassis.

            Capability:

            The T-34 had two fuel tanks located at the rear of the hull, which provided a range of 200-250 km (124-155
            miles) on a full tank of fuel, depending on terrain and combat conditions.

            The fuel system was designed to be easily accessible for refueling and repair, but it did pose some
            vulnerabilities in the event of a direct hit to the rear of the vehicle, where the fuel tanks were located.

          </li>

          <h3>Engine Compartment and Cooling System</h3>
          <li>
            Type: V-2 12-cylinder diesel engine.

            Capability:

            The T-34 was powered by a V-2 12-cylinder diesel engine, which produced around 500 horsepower.

            The engine provided sufficient power for the T-34 to reach speeds of 45-50 km/h (28-31 mph) on roads and
            approximately 30 km/h (19 mph) cross-country.

            The engine was also located in the rear of the chassis, providing better protection for the engine and
            allowing for an easier cooling system configuration.

            The diesel engine offered greater fuel efficiency compared to gasoline-powered engines used by many other
            tanks, reducing the risk of fires and providing a more reliable power source in harsh conditions.
