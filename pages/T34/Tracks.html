          <h3>Track Design</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Continuous steel track with rubber pads.

            Capability:

            The T-34 tracks were designed to be wide and continuous, providing greater weight distribution and reducing
            the ground pressure. This allowed the tank to operate on soft terrain like mud, snow, and sand without
            getting bogged down.

            The rubber pads on the tracks helped to reduce track wear and improve traction on paved surfaces, while also
            making the tank less noisy when moving over hard ground.

          </li>

          <h3>Track Width and Length</h3>
          <li>
            Type: The measurement for the width stands at roughly 40 centimeters which equates to 15.7 inches.

            Capability:
            
            The T-34 achieved superb cross-country mobility because its track width played an essential role. This wide track
            The tracks on the tank spread its weight across a bigger surface which resulted in a significant reduction of pressure applied
            The T-34 tank could cross muddy or snowy terrain more effectively than other period tanks because its track design distributed weight over a larger surface area to reduce ground pressure.
            the period.
            
            The extended track length enhanced vehicle maneuverability across rough or uneven terrain.
            The long track length enhanced the tank's capability to navigate past small ditches, trenches, and debris.

          </li>

          <h3>Track Material</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Hardened steel with rubber inserts.

            Capability:
            
            The T-34 tanks utilized hardened steel tracks which provided exceptional durability to endure heavy
            wear and battlefield conditions.
            
            The tracks incorporated rubber inserts to both enhance traction and minimize wear during operations on
            The use of paved or hard surfaces helped preserve the tracks when tanks were on long road marches.
            
            Steel construction of the tracks provided resistance against damage from rocks and metal debris.
            The tank's combat durability improved because steel tracks resisted damage from artillery shells.

          </li>

          <h3>Track Drive System</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Powered by the rear drive sprockets.

            Capability:

            The T-34's tracks were powered by rear-mounted drive sprockets, which transmitted power from the engine to
            the tracks via the final drive system.

            This configuration made the T-34 more balanced and stable while moving, with the weight of the engine at the
            rear helping to distribute weight evenly across the track system.

            The rear drive system also improved track durability, as it minimized the stresses placed on the track by
            front drive sprockets, which could wear out the tracks faster when exposed to harsh terrain.

          </li>

          <h3>Track Maintenance and Durability</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Designed for easy maintenance and replacement.

            Capability:

            The T-34's track system was designed to be simple and easy to maintain, a crucial feature given the harsh
            environments on the Eastern Front. The tank's modular track design allowed for quick repairs and
            replacements of individual links in the field, which was essential for maintaining operational efficiency.

            The tracks were relatively durable, but given the extreme conditions of combat, wear and tear were
            inevitable. The T-34's design, however, allowed for easy repair and track link replacement while in combat
            zones, ensuring the tank remained mobile even if its tracks were damaged.
