        <h2> Pre-War Tanks</h2>
        <p> Before World War II, tanks evolved from early 20th-century innovations, initially developed during World War
          I by the British and French to break the stalemate of trench warfare. Early models like the British Mark I and
          French Renault FT were slow but showed the potential of armored vehicles in battles like the Somme.

          In the interwar period, tank design advanced with improved speed, armor, and firepower. Germany, the Soviet
          Union, and the UK refined their tanks, such as the German Panzer I and II and Soviet T-26, setting the stage
          for mass tank deployment in WWII.

          After WWII, tank warfare continued to evolve, as seen in the Soviet-Polish War, where tanks played a secondary
          role to Polish cavalry despite limited tank-on-tank battles.</p>

        <h2> WW2 Tanks</h2>
        <p> World War II tanks were faster, better armed, and more protected than previous models, with each country
          developing tanks suited to their strategies. The German Panzer series, including the Panzer IV and Panther,
          were key to Blitzkrieg. The Soviet T-34, with sloped armor and a 76.2mm gun, was highly mobile. The American
          M4 Sherman was reliable and versatile, while the British Churchill and Matilda, though slow, had heavy armor.

          Tanks also aided infantry, breached defenses, and served in anti-aircraft roles. This era saw the rise of
          combined arms tactics, with tanks working alongside infantry, artillery, and air support. </p>

        <h2> Modern Tanks</h2>
        <p> Cold War and modern tanks represent advanced armored vehicles with enhanced firepower, mobility, and
          technology. NATO's M1 Abrams and the Soviet T-90 are examples, with the M1 Abrams featuring a gas turbine
          engine, composite armor, and advanced targeting systems. Soviet tanks like the T-72 and T-80 emphasized
          firepower and ease of production.

          Modern tanks focus on lethality, survivability, and versatility, with advanced armor, fire control systems,
          and electronics like night vision and GPS. They also prioritize mobility with powerful engines and
          sophisticated suspensions for diverse environments. </p>
