      <p class="bptext"> The Tiger I, a German heavy tank used during World War II, was equipped with the formidable
        88mm KwK 36 L/56 gun. This cannon became one of the most feared weapons on the battlefield due to its
        exceptional range, accuracy, and armor-piercing capability. The KwK 36 was capable of penetrating the thickest
        armor of Allied tanks at long distances, particularly effective against Soviet T-34s and British Churchill
        tanks.</p>

        <p class="Ltext">With a barrel length of 56 calibers (4.9 meters), the 88mm gun could fire a variety of
          ammunition types, including armor-piercing, high-explosive, and incendiary rounds.</p>


        <p class="Ttext"> The gun's high muzzle velocity, combined with its precision, allowed it to engage targets at
          ranges of up to 2,000 meters or more.

        <ul class="ammolist">


          <h3>PzGr 40 (Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized - APFSDS)</h3>
        <li>
          Type: A more advanced, fin-stabilized, tungsten core shell.

          Capability: Significantly better at penetrating thick armor than the PzGr 39. It was used against heavily
          armored Allied tanks like the Soviet IS-2, though it was less common due to limited production.

        </li>

        <h3>Gr 39 (High-Explosive - HE)</h3>
        <li>
          Type: Shell with a high-explosive filling.

          Capability: Used against soft targets such as infantry, unarmored vehicles, and field fortifications. The HE
          shell provided significant explosive power but was less effective against armored targets.

        </li>

        <h3>Sprgr 34 (High-Explosive, Fragmentation - HE-FRAG)</h3>
        <li>
          Type: Shell designed to create fragmentation upon detonation.

          Capability: Used primarily for indirect fire, causing widespread damage to enemy infantry, artillery, or
          unarmored targets. It was effective in soft target engagements but not effective against armored vehicles.

        </li>

        <h3>Gr 38 (Incendiary - HEI)</h3>
        <li>
          Type: High-explosive incendiary shell designed to start fires.

          Capability: Primarily used against fuel tanks, ammunition stores, or unarmored vehicles. It could ignite
          flammable materials upon impact, causing secondary explosions and fires.

        </li>
        
        <h3>PzGr 39 (Armor-Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Cap - APCBC)</h3>
        <li>
          Type: Armor-piercing shell with a steel core, capped with a layer of copper.
          Capability: Effective against heavily armored vehicles at long ranges. The ballistic cap improved
          aerodynamics and increased penetration, especially at higher velocities.
        </li>
