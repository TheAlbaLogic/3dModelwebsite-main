      <p class="bptext"> Each of the Tiger I's machine guns played a critical role in the tank's overall combat
        effectiveness, providing firepower against infantry and smaller targets while supporting the main 88mm cannon in
        engaging armoured foes. Though not designed for use against heavily armoured vehicles, the MG34s were vital for
        defense and operational flexibility.`</p>

          <h3>Main Gun Coaxial MG (MG34)</h3>
          <li>
            Type: 7.92mm MG34 machine gun mounted coaxially with the main 88mm cannon.

            Capability: This machine gun was used for close-range defense and suppression of infantry, light vehicles,
            and aircraft. Being coaxial, it was aligned with the main gun, allowing the gunner to aim and fire both
            weapons simultaneously, making it highly effective during combat engagements.
          </li>

          <h3>Secondary MG (MG34)</h3>
          <li>
            Type: 7.92mm MG34 machine gun mounted in the hull and operated by the driver.

            Capability: The hull-mounted MG34 served as a secondary weapon for engaging infantry, vehicles, and light
            fortifications. It was located on the front of the tank, near the driver, and could be aimed through a small
            aperture in the tank's armour.
          </li>

          <h3>Ammunition Type (7.92mm Mauser)</h3>
          <li>
            Type: 7.92x57mm Mauser round, used in both MG34s.

            Capability: This cartridge was widely used throughout the German military during World War II. It was
            effective against soft targets, such as infantry and light vehicles. While not suitable for engaging heavily
            armoured vehicles, it had high volume firepower and could quickly suppress or incapacitate lighter targets.
          </li>

          <h3>Rate of Fire (MG34)</h3>
          <li>
            Rate of fire: 800-900 rounds per minute (RPM).

            Capability: The MG34's high rate of fire made it effective in suppressing enemy infantry and light vehicles.
            The high RPM allowed the Tiger I crew to engage targets quickly, particularly when defending against
            infantry or enemy tanks that might attempt to flank.
          </li>

          <h3>Weight and Size of MG34</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Weighed around 11 kg (24 lbs) for each MG34.

            Capability: Despite its weight, the MG34 was relatively lightweight for its time, which allowed it to be
            mounted on vehicles like the Tiger I. The weight provided stability, but it also required careful handling
            and maintenance due to its complexity and high rate of fire.
          </li>
