      <p class="bptext"> Each of these components contributed to the overall effectiveness and durability of the Tiger
        I's chassis, making it a formidable presence on the battlefield. However, the complex design and heavy weight
        also led to mechanical issues, limiting its numbers and operational capacity during the war.</p>

        <ul class="ammolist">


          <h3>Hull Construction</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Welded and partially cast steel.

            Capability: The Tiger I's hull was heavily armoured, with the front plate being 100mm thick. The sloped
            design improved its effective armour protection against incoming rounds. The combination of thickness and
            slope made it highly resistant to most Allied anti-tank weapons at the time.

          </li>

          <h3>Fuel Tanks</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Two main fuel tanks with a capacity of 500 liters.

            Capability: The fuel tanks allowed the Tiger I to travel approximately 120-150 km on a full tank. However,
            the tank's high fuel consumption was a major drawback, as it required frequent refueling, limiting its
            operational range.
          </li>

          <h3>Engine Compartment</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Maybach HL 230 P45 V-12 petrol engine (700 horsepower).

            Capability: This powerful engine allowed the Tiger I to reach speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) on flat
            terrain. While it gave the tank impressive power, it also consumed large amounts of fuel, limiting its
            operational range.
          </li>

          <h3>Turret Ring</h3>
          <li>
            Type: Large, reinforced turret ring.

            Capability: The turret ring provided a stable and strong foundation for the turret, which housed the
            powerful 88mm KwK 36 L/56 gun. It allowed the turret to rotate smoothly and with precision while maintaining
            structural integrity under fire.
          </li>

          <h3>Armour Thickness (Upper and Lower Hull)</h3>
          <li>
            Type: 100mm of armour on the front hull, with 80mm on the sides and 60mm on the rear.

            Capability: The armour thickness and design made the Tiger I incredibly resilient to small arms fire and
            most
            anti-tank rounds. The steep angle of the front armour further enhanced its ability to deflect incoming
            shells.
          </li>
